it's
important
realize
our
founding
fathers
were
not
christian.
they
deists
akin
today's
agnosticism.
george
washington's
practice
christianity
limited
superficial
christian...
he
repeatedly
declined
church's
sacraments.
never
did

martha,
did,
waited

even

washington
asked
ritual,
uttered
prayer
christ,
expressed
wish
attended
his
representative.
here
are
some
of
the
many
anti-religious
quotes
by
our
founding
fathers:
john
adams
-
"this
best
possible
worlds,
religion

-
"the
divinity
jesus
convenient
cover
absurdity.

gospels
precept

thomas
jefferson
-
"i

christianity

they
alike
founded

-
"christianity

was,
common
law."
benjamin
franklin
-
"lighthouses
helpful
churches."
-
"the
way

shut
eye
reason."
-
"i
looked
god's
judgments,
saw
signs

-
"in
affairs
world,
men

lack
it."
thomas
paine
-
"i

my

each

i

-
"all
national
institutions
churches,
jewish,
christian
turkish,
appear
human
inventions,
set
terrify
enslave
mankind,
monopolize
power
profit."
-
"the

churches,

save
money
research
yourself.
the
proper
role
of
a
government
is
to
remain
agnostic.
and
remember,
our
founding
fathers
did
not
believe
in

this

we
used
this
book
as
a
reference
when
we
bought
our
bichon
frise,
what
a
mistake.
in
the
book
it
states
a
bichon
can
be
a
9-5
dog
so
we
bought
one.
bichons
are
extremely
hard
to
housebreak,all
the
book
says
is
they
'can'
be
hard
to
housebreak.
this
book
has
cost
us
hundreds
of
dollars.
we
ended
up
giving
our
dog
away
tonight
because
we
could
not
get
it
potty
trained
and
after
further
research
found
out
that
bichons
do
not
like
to
be
left
home
alone.
the
book
also
says
that
a
shih
tzu
is
a
nine
to
five
dog
but
after
researching
that
breed
they
also
do
not
like
to
be
home
alone
all
day.
these
two
authors
need
to
find
a
different
line
of
work
because
they
are
complete
idiots
when
it
comes
to
