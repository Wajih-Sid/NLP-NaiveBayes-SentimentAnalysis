my
advice:

the
author
makes
couple
valuable
points.
first,
long-term
investment
strategy
account
existence
recurrent

(i.e.,
indefinitely
long)
bear
markets.
most
leading

bull
market
periods.
most
studies
successful
investment
strategies
biased
recent
1982-1999
bull
market,
anomalous
historical
terms.
the
author
uses
plethora
graphs
charts
prove
"buy
hold"
doesn't
provide
best
returns.
obviously,
then,
it's
better
pull
bear
markets,
that's
easier
said
done.
the
author
provides
complete
analysis
characteristics
bear
markets,
including
p/e
ratio,
inflation
rates,
gdp.
the
problem
characteristics
don't
correlate
market
performance.
for
example,

written
2004

predicted

well,
heeded
advice,

even

it's

by

it's

even

the
author
says

the
book

another
problem

as
say,
past
performance
does
predict

the
investment
advice
provided
useful.
he
suggests
"portfolio
hedge
funds,"
ignoring
fact
hedge
funds
require
minimum
deposit
500k.
he
recommends
"bond
ladder,"
approach
easily
replicated
good
bond
mutual
fund,
frequent
rebalancing
portfolio
asset
allocations.
i
don't
need
spend
$25
hours
reading
learn
that!
one
thing
i
did
learn
book
impact
volatility,
ignored
investment
strategy
recommendations.
volatility
cuts
returns
ways
studies
account
for.
most
studies
just
average

doesn't
reflect
real

let's
say
invest
$100k
stock
returns
35%

-15%
second.
your
average
return
10%

right?
wrong.
at
end
year
135k.
minus
15%
second
year
leaves
115k
total,
equal
7%
year

if
received
10%
year
compounded,
final
total
121k.
that's
6k
difference
just

years,

are
both

we
used
this
book
as
a
reference
when
we
bought
our
bichon
frise,
what
a
mistake.
in
the
book
it
states
a
bichon
can
be
a
9-5
dog
so
we
bought
one.
bichons
are
extremely
hard
to
housebreak,all
the
book
says
is
they
'can'
be
hard
to
housebreak.
this
book
has
cost
us
hundreds
of
dollars.
we
ended
up
giving
our
dog
away
tonight
because
we
could
not
get
it
potty
trained
and
after
further
research
found
out
that
bichons
do
not
like
to
be
left
home
alone.
the
book
also
says
that
a
shih
tzu
is
a
nine
to
five
dog
but
after
researching
that
breed
they
also
do
not
like
to
be
home
alone
all
day.
these
two
authors
need
to
find
a
different
line
of
work
because
they
are
complete
idiots
when
it
comes
to

realize
our

they
deists

george
washington's

he

even

here
are
some
of
the
many
anti-religious
quotes
by
our
founding
fathers:
john
adams
-
"this

possible
worlds,

-
"the

jesus
convenient
cover
absurdity.

thomas

-
"i

they
alike
founded

-
"christianity

common
law."
benjamin
franklin
-
"lighthouses

churches."
-
"the
way

-
"i
looked
god's
judgments,
saw

-
"in

thomas
paine
-
"i

-
"all
national
institutions

jewish,
christian
turkish,
appear
human
inventions,
set
terrify
enslave
mankind,
monopolize
power

-
"the

churches,

save
money

yourself.
the
proper
role
of
a
government
is
to
remain
agnostic.
and
remember,
our
founding
fathers
did
not
believe
in
jesus."
