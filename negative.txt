this
book
badly
written
i
just
couldn't

writing

i
never
bothered
writting

while
i
fully
respect
authors'
decision
providing
book
online
creative
commons
license,
i
doubt
sincerity
intentions,
book
total
f*ck
up.
and
f*ck
understatement.
the
book:
1)
is
unorganized
:-
i
felt
i
bombarded
information
directions.
one
moment
i
getting
ready
test
simple
hello
world"
module,
i'm
suddenly
faced
strange
esoteric
block
diagram
showing
"how
function
calls
function
pointers
used
module
add
new
functionality
running
kernel."
strange
function
names
mentioned
mentioned
rest
chapter.
how
hell
did
i
here?
it
just
pisses
breaks
thought
process
leaves
clueless
frustrated.
2)
is
upside-down:-
i
read
chapter
3
(char
drivers)
i
compare
real
device
drivers
things
just
don't
match.
the
book
theoretical
"real"
device
drivers
functions
mentioned
all.
after
digging
kernel
source
files
googling
internet
i
realize
"real
world"
driver-model
generic
objects
not.
reading
source
code
documentation
online
material
i
actually
understand
"real"
drivers
work.
i
don't
understand
stuff
book.
i
start
wondering
mention
driver-model
i
chapter
14
!!!!!!!
the
driver
model
seems,
opinion,
step
understanding
"real"
drivers
work
i
14
chapters
utter
nonsensce!!
not
that,
authors
decide
"many
driver
authors
ignore

model
entirely"
"the
complexity
device
model
makes
hard
understand
starting
high-level
view"...
surpisingly
easier
understand
online
sources
source
code
documentation
trying
read
chapter
2
book!
3)
is
sadistic:-
one
thing
i
really
hated
carrot-and-stick
approach
authors
chose.
first
small
tiny
taste
topic
finally
relevant
just
feel
you're
reach
somewhere,
complete
u-turn
throw
kinds
irrelevant
off-the-topic
rubish
leaves
sorry
shamefull
expect
better.
you
end
confused,
annoyed,
duped.
like
chapter
2
presented
code
"hello
world"
module.
ok
fine.
seems
easy
enough.
you
naturally
assume
invitation
write
code
yourself.
haha
wroong!
the
book
suddenly
does
"make
hello.c"
showing
content
makefile.
it
leaves
dry
uncompilable-"hello.c"
goes
describing
in
detail
seemingly
random
stuff.
you
left
wondering
makefile
obvious
bother
noting
start
wondering
try
create
simple
makefile
continue
reading
chapter
"as-is".
i
chose
former.
hahaha
wroong
agaaiin!
i
ended
compiling

decide

in

i'd

this

are
both

we
used
this
book
as
a
reference
when
we
bought
our
bichon
frise,
what
a
mistake.
in
the
book
it
states
a
bichon
can
be
a
9-5
dog
so
we
bought
one.
bichons
are
extremely
hard

the
book
says
is
they
'can'
be
hard
to
housebreak.
this
book
has
cost
us
hundreds
of
dollars.
we
ended
up
giving
our
dog
away
tonight
because
we
could
not
get
it
potty
trained
and
after
further
research
found
out
that
bichons
do
not
like
to
be
left
home
alone.
the
book
also
says
that
a
shih
tzu
is
a
nine
to
five
dog
but
after
researching
that
breed
they
also
do
not
like
to
be
home
alone
all

these
two
authors
need
to
find
a
different
line
of
work
because
they
are
