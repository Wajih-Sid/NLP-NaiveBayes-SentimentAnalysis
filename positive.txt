some
people
issue
mccarthy's
grammar,
sentence

(or
lack
thereof).
mccarthy
takes

the
sentences

paid

"breath,"
meaning
don't

some.
as
example,
line

reads:
"the

caught
pierglass
twisted
righted

now,
mccarthy
just

i
was
looking
for
a
practical
and
comprehensive
book
on

with
ideas
i
could
start
using
right
away--this
is
it.
the
amount
of
research
the
author
put
into
documenting
what
the
best
companies
are
doing
to
attract
and
keep
good
people
is
impressive.
my
company
has
been
struggling
for
years
with
the
answers
to
employee

and
now
i
feel
we
have
a
guide
for
all
managers
to
use
as
a
practical

i
like
the
way
&quot;keeping

organized
into
the
four
keys
(representing
the

and
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
overlook
the
importance
of
selecting
the
right
people
in
the
first
place
(nine
chapters
on

you
don't
have
to

can
dip
into
the

why
doesn't
wal-mart

answer:
because

belief
that
he
and
his

as
far
as
they
did
in

it
is
a
wonderful,

of
